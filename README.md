# This is a java code to generate a random maze, and finding its solution using minimum spanning tree.
 ### All you need to do is: 
 * download the Assignment2 file
 * Open the folder in your compiler
 * run Maze main

PS this code isn't the final version of this project, as I am still working to fix some bugs in it.
